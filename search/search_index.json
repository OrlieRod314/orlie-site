This blog is a place where I can share my projects, hobbies, interests, and adventures, without the pressure of chasing algorithms or the expectations of social media platforms. While the internet today is full of incredible tools for connection, it's also shaped by platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit, where visibility is driven more by algorithms than by genuine connection. Here, I\u2019m embracing the freedom to post what I want, when I want, without worrying about what\u2019s trending or whether it will get \"likes\" or shares. The goal of this site is simple: to create a space where I can document and share the things that matter to me. Whether it\u2019s a project I\u2019m working on, a thought I want to explore, or just something I find inspiring, I want this to be a place for deeper dives and a more personal, unfiltered experience. No need to fit into a specific format or chase after viral moments\u2014this is just a space for me to share what I\u2019m passionate about, on my own terms. The beauty of the internet is that there\u2019s still room for all kinds of voices, and this site is my way of carving out a space for mine. If you\u2019re into that kind of open, casual, and thoughtful sharing, I\u2019m glad you found your way here. Let\u2019s keep the spirit of the web alive by making it a space for creativity, connection, and personal expression. Thanks for visiting \u2014 I\u2019m excited to share this journey with you!","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"Hey!
