<p>This does cover topics of obesity, so if body-image stuff is a concern to you, consider processing that before reading this.</p>

<summary>Summary</summary>
<p>Losing weight can be hard! Thankfully with some internal work, it can become much easier, or at least you can come to peace with some of the inherent suffering.</p>
<p>Truly, I think that with the right principles of detachment, acceptance, and awareness, someone can really turn their health around.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Growing up, I had always been sort of a fat kid.
And personally, it didn't really bother me until I was around 15 years old, and I noticed that people noticed (in a negative way).</p>
<p>Being a fat kid is pretty funny until you're in college and then you're just a fat guy.
Even then it's not, like, super bad.
Even so, it's definitely not an ideal you should aspire to.
Of course, what seems like a "quirk" in the moment is actually a very damaging lifestyle that will definitely take its toll on you in the future.</p>
<h2 id="2019-2020-the-fencing-arc">2019-2020: The Fencing Arc</h2>
<p>In Fall of 2019, I entered the University of Arizona Honors College as a Computer Science student.
To get away from home and "find myself", I relocated half an hour away to the Honors Village, a dorm located north of campus.
At the time, I wouldn't have considered myself an athlete in the slightest, other than my brief time in the local Little League back in '08.</p>
<p>One of my highschool classmates at the time invited me to go to the gym with him, just for the sake of getting some exercise in. Honestly, looking back, if it hadn't been for the gym being right next door, I would never have gotten into fencing. </p>
<p>About five minutes into our workout, I saw this man walk into the gym with a strange-looking bag strapped to his body. It looked oblong, as though a long object had been forcibly stuffed into a gym bag. Then he turned slightly to open the double doors to the basketball court, and I saw a sword hilt hanging out. Before this, I had never fenced before, so I had no idea what a guy was doing with a sword stuffed in a bag in the middle of the gym. </p>
<p>I went to investigate, following him through the doors and all the way to the end of the basketball court. Past a large curtain divider that awkwardly split the court in half. </p>
<p>Then I saw a few dozen students in a circle doing stretches. I saw this middle-aged looking man who was directing everyone. I approached him, and he introduced himself as Jay Fowler, the coach of the U of A Fencing Club. And starting that day, I was a fencer. </p>

<p>I'd like to say that my journey as a fencer was a euphoric ride from beginning to end and that I was an ultra Sigma Chad who wiped the floor with everybody and became an anime protagonist. But in reality, my time on the team was defined by several internal struggles, met with the oc</p>
