My name is Orlando Rodriguez, and I'm a Software Engineer / Scientist working at Rincon Research Corporation in Tucson, AZ, USA. Hobbies I enjoy learning languages, gaming with friends, going outdoors, doing TaeKwonDo, and just chilling in general. ABOUT THIS SITE Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This blog is a place where I can share my projects, hobbies, interests, and adventures, without the pressure of chasing algorithms or the expectations of social media platforms. While the internet today is full of incredible tools for connection, it's also shaped by platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit, where visibility is driven more by algorithms than by genuine connection. Here, I\u2019m embracing the freedom to post what I want, when I want, without worrying about what\u2019s trending or whether it will get \"likes\" or shares. The goal of this site is simple: to create a space where I can document and share the things that matter to me. Whether it\u2019s a project I\u2019m working on, a thought I want to explore, or just something I find inspiring, I want this to be a place for deeper dives and a more personal, unfiltered experience. No need to fit into a specific format or chase after viral moments\u2014this is just a space for me to share what I\u2019m passionate about, on my own terms. The beauty of the internet is that there\u2019s still room for all kinds of voices, and this site is my way of carving out a space for mine. If you\u2019re into that kind of open, casual, and thoughtful sharing, I\u2019m glad you found your way here. Let\u2019s keep the spirit of the web alive by making it a space for creativity, connection, and personal expression. Thanks for visiting \u2014 I\u2019m excited to share this journey with you!","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"Hey!

Respectfully, I just want to make sure we can all get along and hurt as few feelings as possible. Summary Losing weight can be hard! Thankfully with some internal work, it can become much easier, or at least you can come to peace with some of the inherent suffering. Truly, I think that with the right principles of detachment, acceptance, and awareness, someone can really turn their health around. Introduction Growing up, I had always been sort of a fat kid. And personally, it didn't really bother me until I was around 15 years old, and I noticed that people noticed (in a negative way). Being a fat kid is pretty funny until you're in college and then you're just a fat guy. Even then it's not, like, super bad. Even so, it's definitely not an ideal you should aspire to. Of course, what seems like a \"quirk\" in the moment is actually a very damaging lifestyle that will definitely take its toll on you in the future. 2019-2020: The Fencing Arc In Fall of 2019, I entered the University of Arizona Honors College as a Computer Science student. To get away from home and \"find myself\", I relocated half an hour away to the Honors Village, a dorm located north of campus. At the time, I wouldn't have considered myself an athlete in the slightest, other than my brief time in the local Little League back in '08. One of my highschool classmates at the time invited me to go to the gym with him, just for the sake of getting some exercise in. Honestly, looking back, if it hadn't been for the gym being right next door, I would never have gotten into fencing. About five minutes into our workout, I saw this man walk into the gym with a strange-looking bag strapped to his body. It looked oblong, as though a long object had been forcibly stuffed into a gym bag. Then he turned slightly to open the double doors to the basketball court, and I saw a sword hilt hanging out. Before this, I had never fenced before, so I had no idea what a guy was doing with a sword stuffed in a bag in the middle of the gym. I went to investigate, following him through the doors and all the way to the end of the basketball court. Past a large curtain divider that awkwardly split the court in half. Then I saw a few dozen students in a circle doing stretches. I saw this middle-aged looking man who was directing everyone. I approached him, and he introduced himself as Jay Fowler, the coach of the U of A Fencing Club. And starting that day, I was a fencer. Wildcat Fencing Badge I'd like to say that my journey as a fencer was a euphoric ride from beginning to end and that I was an ultra Sigma Chad who wiped the floor with everybody and became an anime protagonist.
