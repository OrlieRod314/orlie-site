I share my story with respect for everyone\u2019s journey, and my goal is to avoid unnecessary harm or judgment. \u2139\ufe0f Summary Losing weight is hard\u2014no surprise there. But what did surprise me was how much easier the process became when I started to work on my mindset, not just my body. By learning detachment, practicing acceptance, and becoming more self-aware, I slowly figured out how to turn my health around. This is my story. Introduction: From Fat Kid to Fat Adult =\ua66e= Growing up, I was always kind of the fat kid. For most of my childhood, it didn\u2019t bother me much. I still had friends, I still had fun, and I didn\u2019t think too hard about how I looked. It was just... life. But things shifted when I hit around 15. That\u2019s when I started to realize other people noticed \u2014and not in a good way. Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t just existing in my own little world. I was aware of how others saw me, and that awareness stuck with me like a shadow. Being overweight as a kid? People joke about it. It\u2019s \u201ccute\u201d or \u201cquirky.\u201d Being overweight in college? Not so much. Now you\u2019re just \u201cthe fat guy.\u201d It\u2019s no longer endearing\u2014it\u2019s a problem people assume you should\u2019ve solved by now. And the truth is, I didn\u2019t aspire to be unhealthy. I didn\u2019t want to stay overweight. But I also didn\u2019t fully grasp how damaging the lifestyle was\u2014not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. What seemed like a minor issue at the time was laying the groundwork for years of struggle down the road. 2019-2020: The Fencing Arc =\ua66e= A Chance Encounter =\ua66e= In Fall 2019, I started college at the University of Arizona, enrolling in the Honors College as a Computer Science student. Like a lot of people entering college, I wanted to \"find myself.\" I didn\u2019t go far\u2014just about 30 minutes from home\u2014but moving into the Honors Village dorm felt like a big step toward independence. At the time, I was not athletic by any stretch. The last time I had played a sport was Little League back in 2008, and that had been short-lived. I wasn\u2019t thinking about fitness; I was thinking about getting good grades, surviving college, and maybe figuring out who I wanted to be. One day, a classmate from high school invited me to go to the gym. He wasn\u2019t super into working out either, but we figured, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Plus, the gym was literally next door to the dorm. Low effort, low stakes. What happened next was pure chance\u2014and it changed everything. About five minutes into our workout, I noticed this guy walk into the gym carrying an oddly shaped bag. It was long, narrow, and bulky, like something was stuffed in there that shouldn\u2019t be. I watched as he shifted the bag, and that\u2019s when I saw it\u2014a sword hilt poking out. I was intrigued. I\u2019d never seen someone casually carrying a sword into a gym before, so I did what any curious person would do: I followed him. He went through a set of double doors into the basketball court, past a massive curtain divider that awkwardly split the court in half. I kept following, and at the far end of the court, I saw a group of students stretching in a circle. At the center was a middle-aged guy giving instructions. I approached him, and he introduced himself as Jay Fowler , the coach of the U of A Fencing Club. And just like that, without planning or even understanding what fencing was , I became a fencer. The Ups and Downs of Progress =\ua66e= It would be nice to say that fencing changed my life in a clean, upward arc\u2014that it was all gains, wins, and personal transformation. But life doesn\u2019t work like that. Like most things, it was messy, unpredictable, and full of both victories and setbacks. Still, things started to improve. I lost fat and got fitter\u2014more than I ever had in my life. I started getting attention from the opposite sex and even went on dates (which felt surreal at the time). I was more confident, more social, and overall \u201chappier\u201d\u2014at least on the surface. But here\u2019s the twist: I hadn\u2019t really grown . Not on the inside. All the progress I made physically wasn\u2019t matched by emotional or mental growth. I hadn\u2019t developed discipline, resilience, or real motivation. I wasn\u2019t making these positive choices because I was driven or determined\u2014I was just... lucky. I just happened to have a roommate who cooked healthy meals and was generous enough to share. I just happened to live steps away from the gym, making it effortless to show up for fencing practice. I just happened to be broke enough that I couldn\u2019t buy junk food, even if I wanted to binge. I just happened to schedule fencing practice during the same time I\u2019d normally do my hardest homework. So naturally, I \u201cprioritized my health\u201d instead. It wasn\u2019t discipline\u2014it was convenience. It wasn\u2019t determination\u2014it was avoidance. I didn\u2019t lose weight because I worked hard. I lost weight because it was easier not to fail. And the worst part? I didn\u2019t even realize it. At the time, I thought I was really doing something . But the truth is, I had the misfortune of getting exactly what I wanted, exactly when I wanted it\u2014with none of the growth required to maintain it. 2020-2021: The COVID Arc =\ua66e= Then, as if the universe decided I was flying a little too high, COVID happened. Almost overnight, everything shut down. Classes went online, the gym closed, and the fencing club came to a screeching halt. It felt like someone had hit the \u201cdelete\u201d button on my social life. All that progress? Gone\u2014or at least, that\u2019s how it felt. I lost touch with most of the people I\u2019d gotten to know. Sure, I still had a small group from high school who\u2019d come to the same college, and a few classmates from fencing and CS, but everything else? Radio silence. I was back in my childhood bedroom, trying to focus on Zoom lectures while surrounded by memories of who I used to be. And then, I gained weight. Fast. Like, really fast . Within six months, I didn\u2019t even recognize myself. The mirror felt like a stranger was staring back. The Environment Shift =\ua66e= The environment that had once accidentally set me up for success was gone. There was no gym next door. No roommate cooking for me. No fencing practice conveniently scheduled during my hardest homework time. I was left with just me . And I didn\u2019t know how to handle that. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to put in the effort to eat right or exercise. Everything felt hard. I\u2019d sit at my desk for hours, scrolling, snacking, zoning out\u2014completely disconnected from the version of myself that had once felt \u201cin shape.\u201d It felt like I was made of kryptonite. Like the moment life got hard, I lost all my powers. All my healthy habits collapsed under the slightest pressure. I had become so used to life conforming to me , that when it didn\u2019t, I froze. I couldn\u2019t act. I couldn\u2019t cope with resistance. A Hard Realization =\ua66e= That year taught me a painful truth: If you can only make good decisions when life is easy , you won\u2019t make good decisions at all. There\u2019s a virtue in doing the right thing especially when it\u2019s hard . That\u2019s something I had completely missed\u2014and I paid the price for it. So I wallowed. I sulked. I numbed myself with comfort food and distractions. And I waited\u2014hoping for life to go back to normal so I could go back to being \u201chealthy\u201d without having to work for it. When they announced the return to in-person classes, I was beyond relieved. I thought, \u201cFinally. I can fix this.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t that simple. 2021-2023: Junior and Senior Year =\ua66e= Returning to campus didn\u2019t solve everything. In fact, it hit harder than I expected. Fencing was no longer held at the Honors Village gym. Instead, it had moved to a building on the south side of campus\u2014far from where I lived. Suddenly, that effortless one-minute walk to practice became a 20-minute trek, and I just... didn\u2019t go. My dorm situation also sucked. I won\u2019t go into detail, but let\u2019s just say I had a rough roommate pairing that didn\u2019t help my mental state. On top of that, I got my first student job\u2014long hours, stuck in a chair, no time to work out. No flexibility. No momentum. Silver Linings & Stagnation =\ua66e= Not everything was terrible, though. One of my suitemates became a great friend, someone I\u2019m still close with today. That connection helped me stay afloat mentally, even when I felt like I was failing physically and emotionally. But when it came to health, growth, and getting back on track? I didn\u2019t make much progress. I never really got back into fencing. My academics were intense, and I was dealing with emotional baggage I hadn\u2019t unpacked. Everything felt like too much. Instead of facing it, I pointed fingers. I blamed my roommates. I blamed my job. I blamed the pandemic. I convinced myself that the world was the reason I couldn\u2019t get it together. And that mindset\u2014the refusal to take ownership\u2014followed me through the rest of college. I had a \u201cfailure to launch,\u201d and instead of looking inward, I looked for excuses. 2023-2024: Adulthood and Awakening =\ua66e= In May 2023, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science. And I was 240-something pounds . Let\u2019s be real\u2014that crushed me. Not because of the number, but because of what it represented : Years of missed opportunities, avoidance, and a version of myself I no longer wanted to be. I\u2019d escaped the structured world of school, but now I had to face the unstructured reality of adulthood\u2014and figure out who I actually was when no one else was setting the rules. (continued...) 2024-Now: Deconstructing everything I had ever known about how to live a good life =\ua66e= Eventually, I became really frustrated with the way my life was going. How come I just couldn't change? I started consuming a lot of resources about weight loss, habit building, self-improvement, and all that jazz. After a while I came to a few realizations that fundamentally shaped the way I think about behavior and the art of bettering yourself The First Truth: The Nature of Motivation and Discipline =\ua66e= The First Realization Motivation is the ability to hold a thought in your head for a sustained period of time. I'm not a neuroscientist or anything, but I have done a lot of reading on what separates successful and unsuccessful people. Some people say it's motivation, but that never really stuck right with me. After all, aren't homeless people really desperate to have a home? I've found that it's easier to eat healthier if I simply sit there and imagine myself being healthy and eating the right foods. If I put myself in a situation where there's junkfood, I will naturally just think about junkfood more often that I think about healthy food. The Second Truth: Pain Avoidance and Aggressive Reward-Seeking =\ua66e= The Second Realization If you have to get yourself in the mood to do XYZ. Then you will only be able to do XYZ when you're in the mood. Most people try to approach self-improvement from a perspective of reducing the pain and increasing the incentive. You see this in ideas that get thrown around about \"tricking yourself into wanting to work out\", and stuff like that. This stems from a very weird western idea I've noticed, where people are obsessed with \"taking what they want\" and \"leaving what they don't care for\" out of literally everything in their life. Maybe it's a form of commodification? The Third Truth: Awareness Should Precede Action =\ua66e= The Third Realization It's hard to know what immediate action to take if you don't regularly know where you stand. At the beginning of 2025, I started tracking my weight every morning. I'm aware that body weight fluctuates naturally because of water retention and whatnot. But it was still important for me to get into the habit of recording my weight, body fat percentage, body water percentage, skeletal mass, and muscle mass percentage. I wanted to be able to see the effects of water retention and muscle growth with as much granularity as possible because I'm a scientist and I like watching numbers go up and down and observing trends across long periods of time. Regularly updating yourself on your progress/standing will bring a sense of awareness to your situation. And you will be able to sustain the thought of doing the right thing, the more aware you are of your standing relative to that ambition. The Fourth Truth: The Nature of Sacrifice and Surrender =\ua66e= The Fourth Realization \"You\" will \"never\" benefit from \"your\" sacrifices.","title":"MY WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY"},{"location":"blog/weight-loss/#my-weight-loss-journey","text":"Trigger Warning This post discusses obesity and body image.

One of my suitemates became a great friend, someone I\u2019m still close with today. That connection helped me stay afloat mentally, even when I felt like I was failing physically and emotionally. But when it came to health, growth, and getting back on track? I didn\u2019t make much progress. I never really got back into fencing. My academics were intense, and I was dealing with emotional baggage I hadn\u2019t unpacked. Everything felt like too much. Instead of facing it, I pointed fingers. I blamed my roommates. I blamed my job. I blamed the pandemic. I convinced myself that the world was the reason I couldn\u2019t get it together. And that mindset\u2014the refusal to take ownership\u2014followed me through the rest of college. I had a \u201cfailure to launch,\u201d and instead of looking inward, I looked for excuses.","title":"Silver Linings &amp; Stagnation"},{"location":"blog/weight-loss/#2023-2024-adulthood-and-awakening","text":"In May 2023, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science.

I'm not a neuroscientist or anything, but I have done a lot of reading on what separates successful and unsuccessful people. Some people say it's motivation, but that never really stuck right with me. After all, aren't homeless people really desperate to have a home? I've found that it's easier to eat healthier if I simply sit there and imagine myself being healthy and eating the right foods. If I put myself in a situation where there's junkfood, I will naturally just think about junkfood more often that I think about healthy food.","title":"The First Truth: The Nature of Motivation and Discipline"},{"location":"blog/weight-loss/#the-second-truth-pain-avoidance-and-aggressive-reward-seeking","text":"The Second Realization If you have to get yourself in the mood to do XYZ. Then you will only be able to do XYZ when you're in the mood. Most people try to approach self-improvement from a perspective of reducing the pain and increasing the incentive. You see this in ideas that get thrown around about \"tricking yourself into wanting to work out\", and stuff like that. This stems from a very weird western idea I've noticed, where people are obsessed with \"taking what they want\" and \"leaving what they don't care for\" out of literally everything in their life.

At the beginning of 2025, I started tracking my weight every morning. I'm aware that body weight fluctuates naturally because of water retention and whatnot. But it was still important for me to get into the habit of recording my weight, body fat percentage, body water percentage, skeletal mass, and muscle mass percentage. I wanted to be able to see the effects of water retention and muscle growth with as much granularity as possible because I'm a scientist and I like watching numbers go up and down and observing trends across long periods of time. Regularly updating yourself on your progress/standing will bring a sense of awareness to your situation. And you will be able to sustain the thought of doing the right thing, the more aware you are of your standing relative to that ambition.","title":"The Third Truth: Awareness Should Precede Action"},{"location":"blog/weight-loss/#the-fourth-truth-the-nature-of-sacrifice-and-surrender","text":"The Fourth Realization \"You\" will \"never\" benefit from \"your\" sacrifices.","title":"The Fourth Truth: The Nature of Sacrifice and Surrender"},{"location":"projects/","text":"MY PROJECTS =\ua66e= Here is a collection of some of my projects.
